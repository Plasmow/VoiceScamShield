# 🎙️ Voice Scam Shield – Multilingual AI for Real-Time Call Scam Detection

Voice Scam Shield is a real-time call monitoring system designed to **detect potential scam or fraud calls** using AI speech-to-text transcription and intent classification.  
It can handle **multiple languages**, works with both **live microphone input** and **audio files**, and detects both **scam intent** and **voice spoofing**.

## 🚀 Features
- **🎧 Real-time audio streaming** via WebRTC
- **🌍 Multilingual transcription** powered by OpenAI Whisper
- **🤖 AI intent detection** using multilingual transformer models (Hugging Face)
- **🔍 Voice spoof detection** with spectral feature analysis
- **📈 Smoothed confidence scores** for stable predictions
- **💻 Simple web frontend** for live visualization and transcripts
- **🛠 Fallback heuristics** when AI models are unavailable

---

## 🛑 Problem
Phone scams are a growing problem worldwide, often targeting vulnerable populations.  
Existing solutions usually only block known numbers or work after the scam has already occurred.  
Voice Scam Shield proactively analyzes the call **in real time** to warn the user before sensitive information is shared.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- Elderly or vulnerable individuals
- Customer service teams handling high volumes of calls
- Businesses at risk of phishing or vishing attacks

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Audio capture** from microphone or audio file (via browser frontend)
2. **Real-time streaming** to the backend over WebSocket
3. **Speech-to-text** transcription with Whisper
4. **Intent detection** using multilingual AI model (`joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli`)
5. **Spoof detection** using audio spectral analysis
6. **Smooth scoring** to avoid false jumps in predictions
7. **Frontend display** of transcript, intent, confidence, and spoof score
